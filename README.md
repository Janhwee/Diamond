# Diamond
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. By leveraging data on thousands of diamonds, the model can provide accurate price estimates, which could be valuable for jewelers, investors, and buyers.
